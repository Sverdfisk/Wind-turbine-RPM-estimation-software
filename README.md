### Measuring RPM of wind turbines remotely

Thesis:
"Operators monitoring noise from wind turbines often lack direct access to the turbines’ rotational speed (RPM) data. This master’s thesis aims to address that issue using Sony's IMX385LQR image sensor. 
The research will involve examining possible hardware configurations and exploring software techniques such as image processing. The project will culminate in a proof-of-concept with the goal of developing a prototype capable of monitoring the rotation of wind turbines and reporting their RPM over a given time interval."

The code requires a camera or an input video. The feed path is specified in main.py and the RPM is then calculated.
