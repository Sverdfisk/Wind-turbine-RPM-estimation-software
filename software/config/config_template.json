  "note": "This template is not designed to be used as valid JSON. Copy it and change the fields accordingly.",
  "id": "int. identifier for use in logging to separate runs. Additional runs with the same id value will append results to the same location. Example values: 1, 2, 999123",
  "target": "string. Specifies the path to a saved video or a live video feed. Example value: '/dev/video2'",
  "crop_points": "nested list[int] [[y1,y2],[x1,x2]]. Specifies pixel coordinates. The program will crop away anything OUTSIDE of the specified region. Example value: [[0,320],[100,520]]",
  "ground_angle": "int. The angle from the ground/camera to the turbine hub in radians. Example value (and a neat default): 0.76",
  "fps": "float. how many FPS the video feed or saved video is. Example value: 30",
  "real_rpm": "float. Sets the real RPM of the turbine, if known, to measure error percentage. Set to null if not known. Example values: 21.1, null.",
  "deadzone_size": "list[int]. Sets a radius in x and y directions from the center. Optical flow will not be measured inside this region. Example value: [90,90]",
  "deadzone_offset_x": "int. Offsets the centerpoint of the deadzone, i.e a shift if you do not want it to be centered. Example value: 10",
  "deadzone_offset_y": "int. Same as above in the y direction.",
  "pixel_threshold": "float. Sets the strictness of optical flow tracking. Lower values mean better confidence/lower distance is required to consider a point tracked. Example value: 10",
  "deadzone_shape": "string, either 'square' or 'circle'. Modified the shape of the deadzone. Circle is useful if the turbine is relatively head-on.",
  "mode": "string, either 'bpm' or 'opticalflow'. Sets the calculation mode of the program.",
  "quadrant": "int, either 1,2,3 or 4. Specifies the active quadrant for the bpm mode.",
  "no_x": "bool. Specifies the placement of bounding boxes in the program. With no_x, the boxes will stack vertically and not change their x value when cascaded.",
  "no_y": "bool. Same as above. in the case of no_y, the boxes will cascade horizontally."
